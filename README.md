# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This application generates a random password base on user's selected criteria. The password can include: numbers, special characters, lower and upper case letter. The password length is between 8 and 128. If the user selects length not within those perimeters than it will display an alert to the user. Once all seletions are made a random password will be displayed.
